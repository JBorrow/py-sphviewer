The generation of images of N-body hydrodynamical simulations is an embarrassingly parallel problem, in the sence that the projected density field of one region of the simulated volume is independent on other regions. Thus, an image of a simulated volume an the image a cosmological simulation can be separated into individual images representing disjoint regions of
